# 0x00. Pagination

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

## Introduction

In software development, pagination refers to the process of dividing a large dataset into smaller, more manageable parts called "pages." This README provides an overview of the concepts and techniques involved in implementing pagination, specifically focusing on:

1. Paginating a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters.
2. Paginating a dataset with hypermedia metadata.
3. Implementing pagination in a deletion-resilient manner.

## Getting Started

To get started with pagination, it's essential to understand the basics and key concepts. Here's a brief overview:

- **Simple Pagination**: This involves breaking down a dataset into pages based on predefined parameters such as page number and page size. Users can navigate through different pages to access specific subsets of data.

- **Hypermedia Metadata**: Hypermedia-driven pagination provides additional metadata along with paginated results. This metadata includes links to the first, last, next, and previous pages, enabling clients to navigate through the dataset seamlessly.

- **Deletion-Resilient Pagination**: Deletion-resilient pagination ensures that pagination remains consistent even when items are deleted from the dataset. This involves handling edge cases and updating pagination parameters dynamically.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Simple Pagination

To implement simple pagination, follow these steps:

- Define parameters such as page number (`page`) and page size (`page_size`).
- Retrieve the appropriate subset of data based on the provided parameters.
- Display the paginated results to the user.

### 2. Pagination with Hypermedia Metadata

For pagination with hypermedia metadata, consider the following:

- Along with paginated results, include hyperlinks to navigate to the first, last, next, and previous pages.
- Ensure that the metadata follows standard conventions and is easily interpretable by clients.

### 3. Deletion-Resilient Pagination

- Implement logic to handle deleted items gracefully.
- Adjust pagination parameters dynamically to maintain consistency.
